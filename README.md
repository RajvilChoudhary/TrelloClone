## Database Schema

13 tables: `users`, `boards`, `board_members`, `lists`, `cards`, `card_members`, `labels`, `card_labels`, `checklists`, `checklist_items`, `comments`, `attachments`, `activity_log`

Key design decisions:
- **Float-based positions** — Cards and lists use `FLOAT` position column, enabling fractional indexing for drag-and-drop reordering without renumbering all rows
- **Soft delete (archive)** — Cards and lists have `archived BOOLEAN` to archive instead of hard-delete
- **JSON activity data** — `activity_log.data` stored as JSON for flexible contextual payloads
- **Cascade deletes** — Foreign keys use `ON DELETE CASCADE` to maintain referential integrity

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MySQL 8+
- npm

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Edit `server/.env`:
```
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=trello_clone
```

### 3. Set Up Database

Create the `trello_clone` database in MySQL, then run:

```bash
cd server
npm run db:setup
```

This will:

## Default User

**Rajvil Choudhary (RC)** — ID: 1 (no login required, auto-assigned as current user)

Other pre-seeded members: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol White, David Brown

---

## Assumptions

1. Authentication is omitted; user ID 1 (Rajvil) is assumed to be the logged-in user
2. File attachments are stored locally in `server/uploads/` and served statically
3. Board backgrounds are CSS gradient strings or hex colors
4. The `position` column uses floating-point midpoint insertion for drag-and-drop ordering
5. "Delete" operations are soft-deletes (archive) for lists and cards; hard-delete for boards
